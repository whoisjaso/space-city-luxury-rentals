<objective>
Prepare the platform for production deployment — verify build, configure Vercel, add meta tags, and fix any remaining issues.

Purpose: The final phase ensures everything works in a production build. Vercel configuration handles SPA routing. Meta tags improve SEO and social sharing. Any build warnings or errors are resolved.

Output: Production-ready build, Vercel configuration, meta tags, zero build errors.
</objective>

<tasks>
<task id="1" name="Production build verification and Vercel configuration" type="code">
Do the following:

1. Run `cd app && npm run build` and verify zero errors
   - If any TypeScript errors: fix them
   - If any build warnings about unused imports or variables: fix them
   - If any missing dependencies: install them

2. Verify `vercel.json` at project root has correct configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - This ensures all routes (including /fleet, /fleet/:slug, /book, /admin) serve index.html
   - Vercel serves from the build output directory

3. Update `app/index.html` with proper meta tags:
   - Title: "Space City Luxury Rentals | Houston's Premier Vehicle Experience"
   - Meta description: "Houston's premier luxury vehicle rental. Rent Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, Mercedes-Maybach and more."
   - OG tags (og:title, og:description, og:type, og:image)
   - Favicon (use the logo if available, or keep existing)
   - Viewport meta (should already exist)
   - Theme color meta: #050505

4. Verify routing works:
   - Check that all routes are properly defined in App.tsx
   - Ensure no duplicate routes
   - Ensure catch-all redirect works

5. Check for any console errors:
   - Review code for obvious runtime issues
   - Ensure all imports resolve correctly
   - Verify no missing environment variable crashes (demo mode should work)

6. Add a simple 404/NotFound page component:
   - For routes that don't match anything
   - Shows "Page Not Found" with Space City branding
   - Link back to home
